// ABOUTME: Each click reveals rows, opens or closes timeout windows, and appends history events.
//
// `at` is the click that reveals a thing; click 0 shows the empty diagram and
// the first caption. A slide using a scenario must set `clicks:` to
// `say.length - 1` (checked by TimeoutScenariosTest in
// snippets/src/test/java/io/temporal/devdays/essentials/timeouts/).
//
// The history panel shows only events Temporal records, in the compact form
// the Web UI uses (Workflow Task events are left out of Activity scenarios).
// A retried attempt that times out or fails is NOT an event: the Service
// schedules the next attempt internally, and `ActivityTaskStarted` is written
// only when the final attempt closes, with that attempt's number. Ghost rows
// in the panel say so where it happens, because it is the part people expect
// to see and do not.
