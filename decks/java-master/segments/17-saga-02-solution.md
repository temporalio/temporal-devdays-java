# Solution

- You implement each step as a **local transaction** with a corresponding
  **compensation transaction**.
- If any step fails, you execute compensation transactions **in reverse order** to
  undo the effects of all completed steps.
- You register compensations as each step runs, then automatically trigger them when
  errors occur to ensure cleanup happens reliably.

One minute. The worked example is an order whose courier fails after the stock is reserved and the card is charged.

# The Problem

<SagaFlow panes="without" />

<!--
Source: public/diagrams/saga-flow.html, the "Without compensations" pane. Ported
from the Python Deck.

Two minutes, five clicks: one order whose courier fails, with no
compensations.

Stop on the last step and read the ledger card out loud. `reserve` and
`charge` are marked stranded. The Workflow failed correctly, and two other
systems are still wrong: the stock is held and the card is charged, for a
parcel that will never move. Ask the room what would undo them. A retry will
not: the courier error is non-retryable, and retrying `chargePayment` would
charge the card twice.

The node names and files are real; the order id is an example. The full page,
with the "With compensations" half as well, is public/diagrams/saga-flow.html:
open /diagrams/saga-flow.html in the dev server.
