# Timeouts and Retry Policies

Detect failures with timeouts, then mitigate them with automatic retries.

The idea to land first: Temporal cannot see a crash, a hang, or a network
partition. A timeout is how it notices. A retry is what it does about it.

# Workflow timeouts

<div class="set-in">

Set by the **Client**, when it starts the Workflow:

```java
OrderWorkflow workflow =
    client.newWorkflowStub(
        OrderWorkflow.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
            .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
            .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
            .setWorkflowExecutionTimeout(Duration.ofDays(30))
            .build());
WorkflowClient.start(workflow::processOrder, order);
```

</div>

| Timeout                        | Bounds                                                              | Default        | Option                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Workflow Execution Timeout** | The whole Workflow Execution, including retries and Continue-As-New | Infinite       | `setWorkflowExecutionTimeout` |
| **Workflow Run Timeout**       | A single Workflow Run, excluding retries and Continue-As-New        | Infinite       | `setWorkflowRunTimeout`       |
| **Workflow Task Timeout**      | One Workflow Task, once a Worker has picked it up                   | 10s (max 120s) | `setWorkflowTaskTimeout`      |

Most applications set **none of these**. For time-based logic, use a **Timer**.

<style>
.set-in p { margin: 0 0 0.3rem; font-size: 1rem; }
.set-in pre, .set-in pre code { font-size: 0.72rem !important; }
</style>

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/evaluate/features/timeouts-and-retries#workflow-timeouts.
Code: snippets/src/main/java/io/temporal/devdays/essentials/timeouts/OrderStarter.java.
The tests behind this Deck start this Workflow and find the 30 days on its
WorkflowExecutionStarted Event.

Workflows are built to run for a long time and survive failures, which is why
most applications set none of these. The docs' own guidance: Workflow Execution and Run Timeouts mostly exist to
bound Temporal Cron Jobs. A Workflow Execution Timeout on a business process
means that when it fires, the Workflow just stops, without running any cleanup
code. If you want "give up after 30 days", write it in the Workflow with a
Timer (`Workflow.newTimer` or `Workflow.await` with a timeout) and handle it.

In Java they are `setWorkflowExecutionTimeout`, `setWorkflowRunTimeout` and
`setWorkflowTaskTimeout` on the `WorkflowOptions` the Client builds the stub
with, each a `java.time.Duration`. Not on the Workflow interface: the caller
decides, as with Activities. `setTaskQueue` is the option every start needs,
and you should always set your own business-meaningful `setWorkflowId`. The
Run Timeout's docs default is "same as Execution", which is infinite unless
you set it. The 10-second Workflow Task default and its 120-second maximum are
from the `setWorkflowTaskTimeout` javadoc.

The Workflow Task Timeout is the one that matters in practice, and nobody
changes it. The next slide shows why it exists.

# Workflow Task Timeout

<TimeoutSequence scenario="workflow-task" />

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/evaluate/features/timeouts-and-retries#workflow-timeouts
("the maximum time a Worker has to execute a Workflow Task after picking it up
from the Task Queue").

Step through it. The point is that Workflow Tasks retry on their own, forever:
a Retry Policy does not apply to them. The second Worker replays the history to
rebuild the Workflow's state, then carries on from where the first one died.

The history on the right is the real sequence. After WorkflowTaskTimedOut,
the retry is a "transient" Workflow Task: its Scheduled and Started Events are
written only once it completes, all three together, with `attempt: 2` on
Scheduled. If you see a lot of WorkflowTaskTimedOut in
production, Workers are dying or blocked, not timing out by design.

Not the same thing as the Java Worker's own deadlock detector: Workflow code
that holds its thread for more than one second without yielding to the SDK (a
busy loop, a `Thread.sleep`, a blocking call) gets a
`PotentialDeadlockException`, and that Workflow Task fails. That shows up as
WorkflowTaskFailed, not TimedOut. The one second is the default of
`WorkerOptions.setDefaultDeadlockDetectionTimeout`.

# Activity timeouts

<div class="set-in">

Set by the **Workflow**, on the stub it calls the Activity through:

```java
private final OrderActivities activities =
    Workflow.newActivityStub(
        OrderActivities.class,
        ActivityOptions.newBuilder().setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10)).build());
```

</div>

| Timeout                       | Bounds                                                     | Default                 | Option                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Schedule-To-Start Timeout** | Time an Activity Task waits in the Task Queue for a Worker | Infinite; never retried | `setScheduleToStartTimeout` |
| **Start-To-Close Timeout**    | One attempt, from a Worker picking it up to its result     | Infinite                | `setStartToCloseTimeout`    |
| **Schedule-To-Close Timeout** | The whole Activity Execution: every attempt and every wait | Infinite                | `setScheduleToCloseTimeout` |
| **Heartbeat Timeout**         | The gap between two Heartbeats from a running attempt      | None                    | `setHeartbeatTimeout`       |

Every Activity needs **Start-To-Close or Schedule-To-Close**. Set Start-To-Close:
the Temporal Service cannot see a Worker crash, and this is the timeout that
bounds each attempt.

<style>
.set-in p { margin: 0 0 0.3rem; font-size: 1rem; }
.set-in pre, .set-in pre code { font-size: 0.72rem !important; }
.set-in + table, .slidev-layout table { margin-top: 0.2rem; }
.slidev-layout td { padding-top: 0.35rem; padding-bottom: 0.35rem; }
</style>

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/evaluate/features/timeouts-and-retries#activity-timeouts.
Code: snippets/src/main/java/io/temporal/devdays/essentials/timeouts/OrderWorkflowImpl.java.
The tests behind this Deck find the 10 seconds on the ActivityTaskScheduled
Event.

All four are setters on the `ActivityOptions` the Workflow builds its stub
with: the caller sets them, not the Activity. Every method called through that
stub shares them; make a second stub for Activities that need different
values, or pass per-method options in `WorkflowImplementationOptions`. The
Activity's own code never sets its timeouts.

On the Start-To-Close default: the docs say it defaults to the Schedule-To-Close
Timeout, which is infinite unless you set it. So if you set only
Schedule-To-Close, each attempt inherits that value; set neither and the SDK
refuses: calling the stub method throws an `IllegalArgumentException`
("Both StartToCloseTimeout and ScheduleToCloseTimeout aren't specified") in the
Workflow, which fails the Workflow Task until you fix the code. The tests
behind this Deck check that the Workflow stays running with a failed task.

The next four slides take each in turn. Ask the room to guess, before each
one, which events end up in history. Almost everyone expects to see every
failed attempt. They do not appear, and that is the surprise worth teaching.

# Start-To-Close Timeout

<TimeoutSequence scenario="start-to-close" />

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/evaluate/features/timeouts-and-retries#activity-timeouts.

The one timeout you must understand. It bounds a single attempt and resets on
every retry.

Step 4 is the sentence to say out loud: the Service has no way to see that a
Worker died. It only knows an attempt started and no result came back.
Start-To-Close is how it turns "no news" into "that attempt failed".

Watch the Event History panel at step 7: ActivityTaskStarted appears only now,
with attempt 2. A pending Activity's attempts are not written to history until
it closes; to see a pending Activity's attempt count live, describe the
Workflow (`temporal workflow describe`) or look at the Pending Activities view
in the UI.

Size it to the slowest healthy attempt, not to the whole job.

# Schedule-To-Start Timeout

<TimeoutSequence scenario="schedule-to-start" />

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/evaluate/features/timeouts-and-retries#activity-timeouts.

Rarely set, and the docs say why: it is infinite by default and is never
retried. A task waiting in the queue is a capacity problem (not enough Workers,
or Workers polling the wrong Task Queue name), and retrying the Activity
cannot fix capacity.

Where it does earn its place: routing. If a task waits too long on one Task
Queue, the Workflow can catch the `ActivityFailure`, see a `TimeoutFailure`
cause, and send the work somewhere else.

The usual signal instead is the Activity schedule-to-start latency metric
(`temporal_activity_schedule_to_start_latency`) (covered in the Observability segment),
alerted on, rather than a timeout that fails the work.

# Heartbeat Timeout

<TimeoutSequence scenario="heartbeat" />

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/evaluate/features/timeouts-and-retries#activity-timeouts.

Why long Activities need Heartbeats. With only a one-hour Start-To-Close, a hung
Worker costs you up to an hour. A 30-second Heartbeat Timeout notices in 30
seconds.

Two things happen on the retry, both visible in the diagram: the attempt is
retried, and it gets the last heartbeat details (`200`, read back with
`Activity.getExecutionContext().getHeartbeatDetails(Integer.class)`, an
`Optional`), so it resumes rather than starting over. That is the Heartbeating
segment's code, seen from the Service's side.

The Start-To-Close bar goes grey with "had ~59m left": it never fired. The
Heartbeat Timeout got there first.

# Schedule-To-Close Timeout

<TimeoutSequence scenario="schedule-to-close" />

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/evaluate/features/timeouts-and-retries#activity-timeouts.

The budget for the whole Activity, and the right way to bound retries. It
starts when the Activity is scheduled, so it also covers time spent waiting in
the Task Queue and every backoff between attempts.

The docs' recommendation, and the line to end on: limit retries with
Schedule-To-Close, not with Maximum Attempts. "Give up after 10 seconds" is a
promise a caller can plan around. "Give up after 3 attempts" takes anywhere
from milliseconds to hours, depending on the intervals.

The final event is ActivityTaskTimedOut with timeout type SCHEDULE_TO_CLOSE.
The failed attempts before it are not events.

# Retry Policies

A Retry Policy tells Temporal how and when to try again after a failure.

<div class="cols-2">
<div>
<p class="col-eyebrow">Default for every Activity</p>

| Property             | Default                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Initial Interval     | 1 second               |
| Backoff Coefficient  | 2.0                    |
| Maximum Interval     | 100 × Initial Interval |
| Maximum Attempts     | Unlimited              |
| Non-Retryable Errors | None                   |

</div>
<div>
<p class="col-eyebrow">Activities vs Workflows</p>

- **Activities retry by default:** that is where transient failures happen
- **Workflows do not:** the code is deterministic, so a failed run would
  usually fail the same way again; retry the Activities inside instead
- **Workflow Tasks** retry on their own, outside any Retry Policy

</div>
</div>

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/retry-policies#default-behavior and
#properties. The defaults match `io.temporal.common.RetryOptions` in SDK
1.40.0: 1 second, 2.0, 100 times the initial interval, and unlimited attempts.

The Java shape, with the defaults spelled out, is a `RetryOptions` passed to
`ActivityOptions.newBuilder().setRetryOptions(...)`:

```java
RetryOptions retryOptions =
    RetryOptions.newBuilder()
        .setInitialInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
        .setBackoffCoefficient(2.0)
        .setMaximumInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(100))
        // setMaximumAttempts: leave it unset (or 0) for unlimited; 1 means no retries
        .setDoNotRetry("CardDeclined")
        .build();
```

Code: snippets/src/main/java/io/temporal/devdays/essentials/timeouts/RetryScenarios.java.

In Java, unlimited means leaving `setMaximumAttempts` out, or setting it to
`0`, which is how the server reads it too. A negative value throws
`IllegalArgumentException`.

Maximum Attempts of 1 means no retries at all, and is the setting people reach
for when they mean "don't do this twice". That is an idempotency problem, not a
retry problem: a single network blip or Worker restart then fails the Activity.

A Workflow can be given a Retry Policy when it is started (`setRetryOptions`
on `WorkflowOptions`). The docs recommend it only for Temporal Cron Jobs and
stateless, always-running Workflows.

# Maximum Attempts

<TimeoutSequence scenario="max-attempts" />

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/design-patterns/fixed-count-retries, the same scenario
as its diagram: three attempts against a failing Payment API.

Read the waits as you click: 1s is the Initial Interval, 2s is the Backoff
Coefficient doubling it. With the default unlimited Maximum Attempts, the
fourth retry would wait 4s and so on, up to 100s, forever.

The final event is ActivityTaskFailed with retry state MAXIMUM_ATTEMPTS_REACHED,
and it carries the last attempt's error. Again, attempts 1 and 2 are not in
history; the tests behind this Deck check that the one ActivityTaskStarted says
attempt 3. In the Workflow, the `ActivityFailure` has `getRetryState()`
`RETRY_STATE_MAXIMUM_ATTEMPTS_REACHED`, and its `getCause()` is the last
attempt's error, as an `ApplicationFailure`. An exception that was not an
`ApplicationFailure` keeps its class name as the type, here
`java.lang.IllegalStateException`.

When a fixed count is right: each attempt costs money or a rate-limited token.
Otherwise prefer Schedule-To-Close (two slides back).

# Non-retryable errors

<TimeoutSequence scenario="non-retryable" />

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/retry-policies#non-retryable-errors.

A permanent failure: no number of retries will un-decline a card. Two ways to
stop retrying, and the docs frame it as implementer versus caller:

- **The Activity decides:**
  `throw ApplicationFailure.newNonRetryableFailure("card declined", "CardDeclined")`,
  as on the slide. Use it when the error is always permanent, whoever calls.
- **The caller decides:** `RetryOptions.newBuilder().setDoNotRetry("CardDeclined")`
  in the Workflow's `ActivityOptions`. It matches the failure's type (for a
  plain exception, its fully qualified class name). Use it when only this
  Workflow knows the error is permanent.

The docs say to use them sparingly: invalid input is the classic case. The
Workflow gets an `ActivityFailure` whose `getCause()` is an
`ApplicationFailure` with `getType()` `"CardDeclined"`, and `getRetryState()`
`RETRY_STATE_NON_RETRYABLE_FAILURE`; the tests behind this Deck check both,
after one attempt. The Error handling segment comes back to it.

# Retries in Event History

- **A pending Activity's attempts are not events.** `ActivityTaskStarted` is
  written only when the Activity closes, with the final attempt's number
- **To watch attempts live,** describe the Workflow: the Pending Activities
  view shows the attempt count and the last failure
- **A retried Workflow** ends its run with `WorkflowExecutionFailed`
  (`retryState=IN_PROGRESS`) and starts a new run, whose first Workflow Task waits
  out the backoff

<!--
Source: docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/retry-policies#event-history.

This is why the diagrams' Event History panels stay so short. The design keeps
history from filling up with noise during a long outage: an Activity retrying
every 100 seconds for a day would otherwise add thousands of Events.

The practical consequence for debugging: "the history shows one attempt" does
not mean there was one. Look at the `attempt` field on ActivityTaskStarted, or
at Pending Activities while it is still running.

`temporal workflow describe --workflow-id <id>` prints Pending Activities with
their attempt count and last failure. From Java, `WorkflowStub.describe()`
returns the same description.
