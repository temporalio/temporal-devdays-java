  ## Temporal Essentials, Java
  The Foundations Deck and the pool of conceptual slides every Java
  DevDays Workshop draws from: the case for Temporal, local development, the
  four entities, design patterns, Workflows, Activities, Workers, Clients,
  Signals, Queries and Updates; then Child Workflows, Continue-As-New,
  Heartbeats, Sagas, versioning, data conversion, Schedules, Serverless
  Workers, AI integrations, Priority and Fairness, timeouts and retries, error
  handling, observability and Worker tuning.

  Pull the segments a Workshop needs with `src:` and leave the rest behind.

# Temporal Essentials

## Java · Foundations

<!--
Temporal Essentials, the Foundations Deck for a Java Dev Day. Every snippet
here is idiomatic Java 21 against the Temporal Java SDK 1.40.0, and the code on
each slide is proven by the runnable snippets in `snippets/`.

The opening follows decks/_template: cover, presenter, agenda
(`segments/00-open.md`). Every topic segment after it is self-contained and
starts with its own section divider. To assemble a Workshop, copy the `src:`
lines you want into that Workshop's `slides.md` and drop the rest. The lab
slides are here in `slides.md` rather than in segments, because they belong to a
delivery, not to a topic. Check each lab's minutes before delivering, and add
session breaks if the Dev Day runs over several days.

The through-line, if you do run several segments together: you write the happy
path, and the platform supplies the resilience. Every pattern here is a
consequence of that one trade.

<!--
The lab for Workflows, Activities, Workers and the Client: Your First Workflow,
a money transfer. Learners start a transfer with no Worker and watch it wait,
start the Worker and read the Event History in the Temporal UI, then crash the
Worker mid-bug, fix it, and watch the same transfer finish. The minutes are the Track's time limit, not a measured time; trim them to
fit the day.

Before a Dev Day, swap the Track link on this slide and the two lab slides
below for that Dev Day's short link, so the room types one URL all day.

Leave this slide up while people open the lab. It is the only URL they have to
type, so give them a moment on it.

# Advanced Temporal Topics

Child Workflows, Continue‑As‑New, Heartbeats, Sagas, and beyond.

</ZiggyHero>

<!--
The turn from the fundamentals to the patterns. Everything after this slide
assumes the room is comfortable with Workflows, Activities, Signals, Queries
and Updates.

The tardigrade is Temporal's mascot, chosen because tardigrades survive almost
anything, which is the Durable Execution pitch in one animal. The wizard hat and
wand were added on top of the official art (from the "Temporal in Space" blog
post); there is no official wizard version, so check
with brand before using it outside a workshop.

<!--
The labs for the three sections just taught, in this order. Each is its own
Track; the minutes are each lab's measured length, and each Track's time limit
is 30.

- **Child Workflows** (workshops/child-workflows): run one child, chain
  children five deep and follow a failure up from the bottom, fan out and watch
  the default Parent Close Policy terminate every child, then write the fan in
  with Async.function and Promise.allOf.
- **Heartbeats** (workshops/heartbeats-shipment): crash a Worker ten items into
  a packing job and watch the retry wait out the start-to-close timeout and
  start again at item 0; then add setHeartbeatTimeout, heartbeat(packed) and a
  resume from getHeartbeatDetails, crash it again, and watch the retry start in
  seconds where it left off.
- **Continue-As-New** (workshops/continue-as-new-subscription): a 30-cycle
  subscription is terminated by the Service at its history limit, then rolls
  over on isContinueAsNewSuggested() and finishes. The lab's dev server lowers the
  limits to 40 and 200 Events so both happen in seconds.

Leave this slide up while people open the labs.

The Saga pattern

</ZiggyHero>

<!--
Segments 17-saga-01 to 17-saga-07 follow the Temporal docs' Saga pattern page
section by section. The code matches this repo's
Saga Workshop (workshops/saga-order-fulfillment), so the lab that closes the
section uses the names the slides just taught.
